## Disclaimer
I'm making this project to learn and is not intended for production use.  
You can find most of the technical documentation in the [docs](./docs) folder.

## Contributing
If you find any interset in this project (idk why you would though), and you want to contribute,
feel free to open an issue or a PR.  
Please describe what you are doing as I'm new to C, and I'd like to learn.
